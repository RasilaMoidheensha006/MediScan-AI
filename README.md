Project Name : MediScan AI
Method Used : Medical prescription word detection using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) 

Overview : implemented a simple  Python-based AI algorithm that achieved over 90% accuracy in extracting key information from handwritten medical prescriptions using OCR and NLP techniques, streamlining pharmacy workflow and reducing manual entry time by approximately 60%. 

Libraries used : Pandas , pytesseract , cv2 , 

Impact and Application : 
1 . Automates the extraction of medicine names from handwritten prescriptions, reducing manual entry errors and improving pharmacy workflow.
2. Patients get a awareness about about what they are , what quantity they are going to consume.
